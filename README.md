# EFCore5WebinarDemo
Solution from Oct 29 2020 Pluralsight webinar "PREPARING YOUR MOVE TO ENTITY FRAMEWORK CORE 5: WHAT’S NEW AND WHAT’S IMPROVED".
Watch the [recorded video](https://www.pluralsight.com/resource-center/webinars/entity-framework-core-5/thank-you)

Note that there are two branches: Before and After. Before was my starting point for the demos and After is where it ended.

I also showed a demo from the Microsoft Docs on a EF Core 5 implementation of a Blazor app using EF Core's new AddDbContextFactory method. You can find the code at
